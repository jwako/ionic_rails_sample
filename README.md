Ionic + ng-token-auth Demo
================

This is a [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) application fully configured to work with the [ng-token-auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/ng-token-auth).
If you use [devise_token_auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth) gem as a server-side authentication,
you can integrate client-side application with server-side seamlessly.
